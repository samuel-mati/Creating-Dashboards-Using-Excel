### Cleaning the Data
Cleaning- Clean the data by removing duplicate values, Created new column(Age Bracket) using this <=IF(L3>=55,"Old",IF(L3>=31,"Middle Aged",IF(L3<31,"Adolescent","Invalid")))> formula, Find and Replace Values( Replace M and S in the Marital Status Column to Married and Single respectively. Also Replace F and M in the Gender section to Female and Male respectively
### Creating Visualizations
Created 3 Pivot tables; One for Average Income vs Number of Bikes Purchased, Another one for Age Brakets Vs Purchased Bikes and the Last One for Commute Distance vs Purchased Bikes
### Final Dashboard
Using the 3 Charts from the Pivot tables, I created a simple Dashboard with the following features
It  has 3 slicers; Marital Status, Region and Education
THis is helpful to enable a responsive filtering to show different scenarios in the data
